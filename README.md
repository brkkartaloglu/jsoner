I hosted both backend and frontend in IIS.
For frontend, place your build folder (create with this coomand -> npm run build) in inetpub\yourwebsite, then create application pool and website in IIS manager.
For backend, place server folder under the inetpub\yourwebsite, then create a web application in your website via IIS manager, then give server folder as a path. To configure IIS as reverse proxy you need to install the URL Rewrite extension and the Application Request Routing extension. Add the address of your node.js website, don't forget to include the port, to the reverse proxy rules.
